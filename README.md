  # üë©‚Äçüíª About

This application was createn due to the need of simplifying MySQL usage implementing JavaScript code in order to be able to interact with it. In the present code, you'll find new JS libaries that will contribute to reach the end goal mentioned.

It's also important to mention, that the present application contains code provided by a coding bootcamp academy and my main responsibility was to integrate the required sequelize framework to make the app work properly.

Some of the changes made by me were:

* Create the models with their corresponding references.

* Establish the relationships in the index.js file located in the models folders between the different models.

* Establish the request types for each model.

* Modify the server.js file to sync the server with the application.

* Modify the .env file to secure the database data.
